==========================================
  FINAL STEP - MUST BE DONE IN XCODE GUI
==========================================

The command line CANNOT create a development team.
Apple requires this to be done in Xcode's interface.

This is a ONE-TIME setup that takes 2 minutes.


WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:
====================

1. Look at your Mac screen
2. Find the blue Xcode icon in your dock (bottom of screen)
3. Click it ONCE

4. When Xcode opens:
   - Left sidebar → Click "MetaGlassesApp" (blue icon at top)
   - Main panel → Click "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Check the box: "Automatically manage signing"
   - Click "Team" dropdown → Add your Apple ID
   - Xcode creates a free developer certificate

5. Top of Xcode → Click device selector → Choose "iPhone (26.2)"

6. Click ▶️ Play button

7. Wait 2-3 minutes

8. App installs to iPhone automatically!


WHY THIS IS REQUIRED:
====================

Apple's security requires:
- Development team (your Apple ID)
- Code signing certificate
- Provisioning profile

The command line can BUILD code, but it cannot CREATE these credentials.
Only Xcode's GUI can create them for the first time.

After this ONE-TIME setup, command line works fine!


THAT'S IT!
==========

Just those 8 steps in Xcode GUI.
Then you'll have your 110+ feature app running!
