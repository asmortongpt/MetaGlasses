  🔓 TRUST DEVELOPER - ALL POSSIBLE PATHS
==========================================

iOS has different menu names depending on version.
Try these paths IN ORDER until you find one that works:


PATH 1 (iOS 15-17):
===================
Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
   → Developer App section
   → Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com
   → Trust


PATH 2 (Older iOS):
===================
Settings → General → Profiles & Device Management
   → Developer App section
   → Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com
   → Trust


PATH 3 (Older iOS):
===================
Settings → General → Device Management
   → Developer App section
   → Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com
   → Trust


PATH 4 (Older iOS):
===================
Settings → General → Profiles
   → Developer App section
   → Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com
   → Trust


ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
===================

If NONE of those paths exist, the certificate might not be installed yet.

Try this:

1. Delete the app from your iPhone (long press → Remove App)

2. On your Mac, run this command to open Xcode:
   open -a Xcode MetaGlassesApp.xcodeproj

3. In Xcode:
   - Click your iPhone at the top (next to Play button)
   - Select your iPhone from the dropdown
   - Click the ▶️ Play button

4. Xcode will install and you should see the trust dialog


STILL NOT WORKING?
==================

Try searching in Settings:

1. Open Settings app
2. Tap the Search bar at the top
3. Type: "trust"
4. Look for results mentioning "profiles" or "developer"
5. Tap the matching result


OR try searching for:
- "profiles"
- "device management"
- "developer"


WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
=================

You're looking for a menu that shows:
   "Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com"

Under a section labeled:
   "Developer App" or "Enterprise App"

With a button that says:
   "Trust" or "Verify"


NUCLEAR OPTION:
===============

If you absolutely cannot find it:

1. Settings → General → Reset → Reset All Settings
   (This won't delete data, just settings)

2. Try installing the app again from Xcode


==========================================
