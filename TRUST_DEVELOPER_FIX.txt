  🔓 FIX "UNTRUSTED DEVELOPER" ERROR
==========================================

This is a normal iOS security feature!
Here's how to trust yourself as a developer:


EXACT STEPS ON YOUR IPHONE:
============================

1. Open SETTINGS app on your iPhone

2. Scroll down and tap "General"

3. Scroll down and tap "VPN & Device Management"
   (Sometimes called "Device Management" or "Profiles & Device Management")

4. Under "DEVELOPER APP" section, you'll see:
   "Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com"

5. Tap on "Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com"

6. You'll see a screen with app details

7. Tap the blue "Trust" button
   (It will say "Trust 'Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com'")

8. A popup appears: "Trust this developer?"
   Tap "Trust"

9. ✅ Done! Go back to home screen

10. Tap the MetaGlasses app icon again

11. App will now open!


IF YOU DON'T SEE "VPN & DEVICE MANAGEMENT":
===========================================

Try this path instead:
   Settings → General → Profiles
   OR
   Settings → General → Profiles & Device Management

The menu name varies slightly by iOS version.


VISUAL GUIDE:
=============

Settings
  └─ General
      └─ VPN & Device Management
          └─ Apple Development: asmorton@gmail.com
              └─ [Trust] button ← TAP THIS


WHAT THIS DOES:
===============

iOS requires you to explicitly trust apps from developers
who aren't in the App Store. Since you're installing your
own app for development, you need to trust yourself!

This is a ONE-TIME setup. Once trusted, all your apps
will work without this step.


AFTER TRUSTING:
===============

1. Return to home screen
2. Tap MetaGlasses app
3. App opens successfully!
4. Grant permissions when asked


==========================================

DO THIS ON YOUR IPHONE NOW!
