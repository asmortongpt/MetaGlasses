  FIX THE SIGNING ERROR - 5 CLICKS
==========================================

You're seeing:
"Signing for MetaGlassesApp requires a development team"

This is GOOD! You're in Xcode and we just need to add your Apple ID.


DO THIS RIGHT NOW IN XCODE:
==========================

1. In the LEFT SIDEBAR of Xcode:
   - Click the BLUE icon at the very top
   - It says "MetaGlassesApp"

2. In the MAIN PANEL (center/right area):
   - You'll see tabs: General, Signing & Capabilities, etc.
   - Click "Signing & Capabilities"

3. You'll see:
   - [ ] Automatically manage signing (UNCHECK checkbox)
   - Team: None (dropdown)

4. CHECK the "Automatically manage signing" box

5. Click the "Team" dropdown:
   - If you see your name/Apple ID → SELECT IT
   - If you see "Add Account..." → CLICK IT
     - Sign in with your Apple ID
     - Xcode creates free developer certificate
     - Then select your name as Team

6. Xcode will show:
   ✅ Signing Certificate: Apple Development
   ✅ Provisioning Profile: Xcode Managed Profile

7. At the TOP of Xcode window:
   - Click where it shows device name
   - Select "iPhone (26.2)"

8. Click the ▶️ PLAY button (big triangle at top left)

9. Wait 2-3 minutes - Xcode builds and installs!

10. DONE! App appears on your iPhone!


THAT'S IT!
==========

Those 10 steps take 2 minutes.
Then your app is ready to use!
